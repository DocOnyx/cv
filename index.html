        <p>I am an Ophthalmologist with special interest in Glaucoma and Medical Retina.
            I am very passionate about eye care delivery, especially in undeserved communities. My long-term goal is to
            facilitate delivery of standard eye care to citizens and residents of my home country and be at the
            fore-front of mentoring younger colleagues.</p>
        <p>I am intrigued by the advances in technology globally as well as its expansive potentials both in
            Ophthalmology and other facets of life.
            I always strive to build new skills and I am currently working towards being a Python Programmer
            and Web Developer. I am a diligent and dedicated worker with top-notch professional and networking
            skills</p><p>I am happily married and blessed with 3 adorable children, who are my pride. In my leisure
            time, I love to relax with family, read books, swim and visit new places. I also enjoy singing and
            writing articles for public eye health education.</p>
